# About this script
It aims to pull various stats based on SirWeezle's theory that the various increments we see in the AMIC count up could be a hidden binary message. This script does not shoot at decoding anything, just to analyze the data we've got to support theories / guesses / hunches & the like

# So far
Still looking for patterns, nothing conclusive yet.
As the only data recorded to date is from 5% and up, if there is something to be found in there, it probably will be a repeating pattern, _if_ there is something to be found.
So far no luck.


# How to use
This script uses http://pixelondemand.com/amic/ xlsx export. Once downloaded, you still have to export it to CSV (no modifications, just export it as is) and the script will take care of the rest.

The most interesting bit is probably the counts of all the increments, outliers included, still difficult to tell if the binary message theory is sound.
