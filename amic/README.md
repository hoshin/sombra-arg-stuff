# About this script
It aims to pull various stats based on SirWeezle's theory that the various increments we see in the AMIC count up could be a hidden binary message. This script does not shoot at decoding anything, just to analyze the data we've got to support theories / guesses / hunches & the like

# So far
Still looking for patterns, nothing conclusive yet.
As the only data recorded to date is from 5% and up, if there is something to be found in there, it probably will be a repeating pattern, _if_ there is something to be found.
So far no luck.


# How to use
This is a shell script that needs a CSV file as input to be run, the 1st collumn being the record timestamp, the 2nd the %age increment at corresponding timestamp, the 3rd an attempt at "binary-fying" the increases (optional, you'll probably get the most useful stats w/ the 1st 2 columns).

The most interesting bit is probably the counts of all the increments, outliers included, still difficult to tell if the binary message theory is sound.
